### For Compiling

#### Step 1: Install System Packages

You still need to install tkinter from your distribution's package manager, as it's a system dependency and not a Python package that can be installed with pip or uv.

##### For Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
apt-get install python3-tk
```

##### For Fedora

```bash
dnf install python3-tkinter
```

##### For Arch

```bash
pacman -S tk
```

#### Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

Navigate to your project's directory and create a new virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv --system-site-packages
source venv_name/bin/activate
```

You'll know it's activated when your command prompt changes to include the name of the virtual environment.

#### Step 3: Install Python Libraries

With the virtual environment active, install the required Python packages using pip or uv. They will be installed within your virtual environment, leaving your system's global packages untouched.

##### Using pip

```Bash
pip install tkinterdnd2 customtkinter pyinstaller pillow
```

##### Using uv

```Bash
uv pip install tkinterdnd2 customtkinter pyinstaller pillow
```

#### Step 4: Compile the Binary

Finally, run the pyinstaller command. Since your venv is active, pyinstaller will use the libraries you just installed.

```Bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --noconfirm --icon="icon.png" --add-data="icon.png:." HB_dreamSort.py
```

This will create a standalone executable in the dist folder of your project directory.

For Windows Python Pyinstaller compilation

```powershell
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --noconfirm --icon="icon.png" --add-data="icon.png:." HB_dreamSort.py
```
